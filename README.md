Notes for UX Design on FAC5

User Experience consists of two main elements: Wireframing and User Stories. This is a repo to store & disseminate information on both for FAC5 teams.

This repo contains a brief description of user stories, wire framing, mobile-first design and online tools used to create the presentation.

User experience design involves the needs of the users of the software as well as the design processes used to create the software itself. Wireframing and user stories are aligned to agile software development - an iterative and evolutionary process of software design.
