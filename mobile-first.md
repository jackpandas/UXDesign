Mobile First Design

Contemporary web design is oriented towards producing web sites and applications for mobile devices.

This is driven by the growth in smartphone usage (25% of web users are mobile-only) as well as industry leaders (Google).

Mobile-first design is an evolution of responsive design - designing web sites to display and function on any array of devices.

There are two ways of thinking about the relationship between design for mobile and desktop environments:

- Graceful Degradation: Sites are designed for desktop, and features are gracefully removed to fit iPads and mobile devices.
- Progressive Enhancement: Sites are designed for mobile, and features are added to enrich desktop use.
