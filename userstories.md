###**User Stories**

* Prompts that guide the development of a product
* Not a specification, but a communication and collaboration tool — part of the conversation between the product manager and the development team
* Short statements written on cards

#####Epic vs. Small-Scale Stories

* “Epic” stories involve looking at the product on a macro scale, and will include a series of micro user stories — starting with epics is good for capturing the full scope of a project
* Smaller-scale stories are more detailed and literal experiences the user will have with the product/site

#####Writing a User Story

* **As a** [role]**, I want** [goal/desire], **so that** [benefit].
* Example: **As a** game player **I want** to get push notifications when I have more lives **so that** I know when I can play the game again.
* It can be useful to create "personas" of people who may be using the product, and imagine their user stories.

#####Testing the Story

* Acceptance criteria describes the conditions that have to be fulfilled so that the story is done, making the story testable
